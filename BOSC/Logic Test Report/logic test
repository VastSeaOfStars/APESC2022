1. Test environment
System: Windows10; Jdk17;

2. Test objectives
(1) Check whether the logic of 200 solidity bytecodes has changed before and after obfuscation
(2) Check whether the newly added obfuscated instructions in the bytecode after obfuscation are skipped
(3) Check whether the main logic path of the obfuscated bytecode control flow graph exists
(4) Check whether there is any significant change in the running time of the bytecode before and after obfuscation

3. Test results
(1) 200 solidity bytecodes can run before and after obfuscation
(2) The logic of the solidity bytecode before and after obfuscation is consistent with the original
(3) The bytecode main path exists before and after obfuscation
(4) There is no significant change in the running time of solidity bytecode before and after obfuscation, all meeting expectations
